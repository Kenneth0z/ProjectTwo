<section><h4>The history of Seaside Park</h4>
<p>
  The construction of Seaside Park began in 1999 and was finished in 2009.
  The founder, Henry Doe began construction of the park with the goal of creating a unique experience that a variety of people would enjoy.
  For the first few years of construction, Henry had trouble settling on a name for the park, going through several names such as "Coastermania" and "Coaster Park".
  The name of the park wasn't settled on until Henry's friend, Chloe Dawn, suggested the name "Seaside Park" to coincide with the location that the park was being built being so close to an ocean.
  Henry immediately took a liking to the name and later into the creation of the park would also give the names of each ride an oceanic theme to coincide with the parks' name.
