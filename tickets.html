<section><h4><b>About Park tickets</b></h4>
<p>
  This page is where you can view information about both our tickets and passes.
  Purchasing tickets alone is the cheapest way to attend the park, however the passes here on this page all provide a variety of benefits that may significantly improve the experience at Seaside Park.
  We recommend browsing through all of the options that we offer in order for you to decide which options you believe are the best for your upcoming visit or visits.
   You may purchase either physical tickets or digital tickets. Physical tickets are delivered to you through your mailing address upon completion of your purchase. 
   Physical tickets are to be handed in at the entrance to Seaside Park on the day of your visit.
   Digital tickets on the other hand are delivered to you via your provided email address and may be printed to be used in the same manner as a physical ticket
    or can be saved as an image to be scanned at the entrance to Seaside Park on the day of your visit.
